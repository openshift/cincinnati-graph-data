name: stable-4.4
versions:
# Because we cannot block edges by channel the only way to prevent 4.3 to 4.4
# upgrades in the stable channel but prevent errors from being thrown is to
# temporarilly remove 4.3 versions. Once we intend to promote the 4.3 to 4.4
# edge to stable we will re-introduce these 4.3 versions. 4.3.12 and 4.3.13
# are safe but nothing 4.3.18+ should be added since it includes edges to 4.4
- 4.3.12
- 4.3.13
# No 4.3.14 because it was missing version which 4.3.14 can be upgraded. It is rebuilt as 4.3.15
# - 4.3.18 temporarily to prevent 4.3 to 4.4.0
- 4.4.3
