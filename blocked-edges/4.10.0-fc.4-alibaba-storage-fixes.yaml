name: AlibabaStorageDriverDemo
message: |-
  The Alibaba storage driver was updated from a patched 1.1.4 to a patched 1.1.6 in 4.10.0-rc.0.  That is unlikely to fix anything that regressed in this provider from fc.3 to fc.4, but this conditional update is pretending it does, as a demonstration of the conditional update system.
