# Cincinnati Graph Data

[Cincinnati][] is an update protocol designed to facilitate automatic updates.
This repository manages the Cincinnati graph for OpenShift.

## Workflow

The [contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers licencing and the usual Git flow.

1. Create a PR.
1. Merge the PR to master.
1. Update your local master branch.

[Cincinnati][] is configured to track the master branch, so it will automatically react to updates made to this repository.

### Schema Version

The layout of this repository is versioned via [a `version` file](version), which contains the [Semantic Version][semver] of the schema.
As a schema version, the patch level is likely to remain 0, but the minor version will be incremented if backwards-compatible features are added, and the major version will be incremented if backwards-incompatible changes are made.
Consumers, such as [Cincinnati][], who support *x.y.0* may safely consume this repository when the stated major version matches the understood *x* and the stated minor version is less than or equal to the understood *y*.
For example, a consumer that supports 1.3.0 and 2.1.0 could safely consume 1.2.0, 1.3.0, 2.0.0, 2.1.0, etc., but could not safely consume 1.4.0, 2.2.0, 3.0.0, etc.

### Release Names

Release names are used for [adding releases to channels](#add-releases-to-channels) and [blocking edges](#block-edges).
Architecture-agnostic names will apply to all images with that exact name in the `version` property of the `release-metadata` file included in the release image.
Names with [SemVer build metadata][semver-build] will apply only to releases whose exact name in the `version` property matches the release with the build metadata removed and whose referenced [image architecture][image-arch] matches the given build metadata.
For example, 4.2.14 will apply to both the amd64 and s390x release images, since those both have `4.2.14` in `version`.
And 4.2.14+amd64 would only apply to the amd64 release image.

### Add Releases To Channels

Edit the appropriate file in `channels/`.
For example, to add a release to candidate-4.2 you would edit [`channels/candidate-4.2.yaml`](channels/candidate-4.2.yaml).

The file contains a list of versions.
Please keep the versions in order.
And LEAVE COMMENTS if you skip a version.

#### Feeder Channels

Channel semantics, as documented [here][channel-semantics], show nodes and edges being promoted to successive channels as they prove their stability.
For example, a 4.2.z release will appear in `candidate-4.2` first.
Upon proving itself sufficiently stable in the candidate channel, it will be promoted into `fast-4.2`.
Some time after landing in `fast-4.2`, it will appear in `stable-4.2`.

_Note:_ Once we have phased release rollouts, we will drop the fast/stable distinction from this repository and promote to a unified fast/stable channel with a start time and rollout duration.
Until then, we are using fast channels to feed stable channels with a delay, just like candidate channels feed fast channels.

In this repository, the intended promotion flow is reflected by a `feeder` property in the channel declaration.
For example, for [`channels/fast-4.2.yaml`](channels/fast-4.2.yaml):

```yaml
feeder:
  name: candidate-4.2
  errata: public
  filter: 4\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(.*hotfix.*|\+amd64|-s390x)?
```

which declares the intention that nodes and edges will be considered for promotion from `candidate-4.2` into `fast-4.2` after the errata becomes public.
The optional `errata` property only accepts one value, `public`, and marks a public errata as sufficient, but not necessary, for promoting a feeder node.
The `filter` value excludes `4.2.0-rc.5` and other releases, while allowing for `4.2.0-0.hotfix-2020-09-19-234758` and `4.2.10-s390x` and `4.2.14+amd64`.

Another example is [`channels/stable-4.2.yaml`](channels/stable-4.2.yaml):

```yaml
feeder:
  name: fast-4.2
  delay: PT48H
```

which declares the intention that nodes and edges will be considered for promotion from `fast-4.2` into `stable-4.2` after a delay of 48 hours.
The `delay` value is an [ISO 8601][rfc-3339-p13] [duration][iso-8601-durations], and spending sufficient time in the feeder channel is sufficient, but not necessary, for promoting the feeder node.

If both `errata` and `delay` are set, the feeder nodes will be promoted when `delay` has elapsed or the release errata becomes public, whichever comes first.

To see recommended feeder promotions, run:

```console
$ hack/stabilization-change.py
```

##### Tombstones

Removing a node from a channel can strand existing clusters with a `VersionNotFound` error.
To avoid that, unstable nodes are left in their existing channels, but should not be promoted to additional channels.
This is reflected through entries in the optional `tombstones` property.
For example, [`channels/candidate-4.2.yaml`](channels/candidate-4.2.yaml) has:

```yaml
tombstones:
- 4.1.18
- 4.1.20
```

declaring that, while 4.1.18 and 4.1.20 are in `candidate-4.2`, they should not be promoted to subsequent channels (in this case, `fast-4.2`).

### Block Edges

Create/edit an appropriate file in `blocked_edges/`.

* `to` (required, [string][json-string]) is the release which has the existing incoming edges.
* `from` (required, [string][json-string]) is a regex for the previous release versions.
    If you want to require `from` to match the full version string (and not just a substring), you must include explicit `^` and `$` anchors.
    Release version strings will receive [the architecture-suffix](#release-names) before being compared to this regular expression.
* `url` (optional, [string][json-string]), with a URI documenting the blocking reason.
    For example, this could link to a bug's impact statement or knowledge-base article.
* `name` (optional, [string][json-string]), with a CamelCase reason suitable for [a `ClusterOperatorStatusCondition` `reason` property][api-reason].
* `message` (optional, [string][json-string]), with a human-oriented message describing the blocking reason, suitable for [a `ClusterOperatorStatusCondition` `message` property][api-message].
* `matchingRules` (optional, [array][json-array]), defining conditions for deciding which clusters have the update recommended and which do not.
    The array is ordered by decreasing precedence.
    Consumers should walk the array in order.
    For a given entry, if a condition type is unrecognized, or fails to evaluate, consumers should proceed to the next entry.
    If a condition successfully evaluates (either as a match or as an explicit does-not-match), that result is used, and no further entries should be attempted.
    If no condition can be successfully evaluated, the update should not be recommended.
    Each entry must be an [object][json-object] with at least the following property:

    * `type` (required, [string][json-string]), defining the type in [the condition type registry][cluster-condition-type-registry].
        For example, `type: promql` identifies the condition as [the `promql` type][cluster-condition-type-registry-promql].

    Additional properties for each entry are defined in [the cluster-condition type registry][cluster-condition-type-registry].

For example: to block all incoming edges to a release create a file such as `blocked-edges/4.2.11.yaml` containing:

```yaml
to: 4.2.11
from: .*
```

If you wish to block specific edges it might look like:

```yaml
to: 4.2.0-rc.5
from: ^4\.1\.(18|20)[+].*$
```

The `[+].*` portion absorbs [the architecture-suffix](#release-names) from the release name that consumers will use for comparisons.
